<%= render 'form', post: Post.new %> 

<!--

	Create a form at posts#new to create a new post. 
	#The form should include 
		#[] check boxes for us to select categories 
		#[] a text field to create a new category
	#		do this with a nested form so that our controller stays thin.
	#	[] Accept only unique (new) category
	#	e.g., if we type in a category that already exists, we should select it from the database and associate the post we've created with the existing category. -->
