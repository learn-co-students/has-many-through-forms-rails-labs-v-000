# Below, categories_hashes is a hash with 'indexed' keys of "0" and "1",
# EACH of which points to a hash containing 1 key/value pair of name attribute data
# for a single category instance that the post will be included in.
# categories_hashes looks something like this:
# {"0" => {"name" => "name of a category"}, "1" => {"name" => "name of another category"}}
# We want to create a category instance for each of the hashes inside categories_hashes
# When you iterate over a hash, you get 2 variables yielded to you, i.e., |key,value|
# Iterate over categories_hashes
# 1st variable yielded is i to stand for index ("0" and "1" keys)
# 2nd variable yielded is category_attributes to represent this part: {"name" => "name of a category"}

      # I need to create a category instance that is already associated with this post instance
      # and I need to make sure that a category instsance with this same name attribute value doesn't already exist
      if category_attributes[:name].present? # If field to enter new category's name is NOT blank
        category = Category.find_or_create_by(name: category_attributes[:name]) # find or create the category instance regardless of whether this post has it...

      # To associate a post and a category, insert a row into the post_categories join table
      # instantiate an instance of PostCategory join model, which belongs_to a post and belongs_to a category
      # the instance of the PostCategory join model is already associated to the post instance (self),
      # and then we're just passing in the category
      # the category instance that the PostCategory join model instance belongs_to is the category instance just created
